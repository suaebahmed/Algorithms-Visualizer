## Algorithms Visualizer

Algorithms Visualizer is a comprehensive web application designed to visualize various algorithms without relying on any specific UI library. It's built using React and offers an interactive platform to understand and observe the behaviors of different algorithms in real-time.

### Features:

1. **Path Finding:**

   - **Concepts:** Representing a grid as an implicit graph where each cell denotes a node.
   - **Search Algorithms:** Implementations of Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, A\* Search, and Dijkstra.
   - **Pattern Generation Algorithms:** Includes Basic random, Randomized DFS, Recursive division, Kruskal's Algorithm, and Prim's Algorithm.
   - **User Interaction:** Users can draw wall nodes, drag and drop source/target nodes, and control animation speed.

2. **Sorting:**

   - **Concepts:** Bars representing positive integer values compared for ascending order.
   - **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort, Merge sort.
   - **User Controls:** Adjust bar sizes, generate new random bars, and control animation speed.

3. **Spiral Prime:**

   - **Concepts:** Grid displaying positive integer numbers checked for primality.
   - **Features:** Counting total prime numbers, creating a spiral from the center of the grid.

4. **N Queen Problem:**
   - **Concepts:** Chess board representation where queens are placed and checked for mutual attacks.
   - **Features:** Resize the chess board and control animation speed.
